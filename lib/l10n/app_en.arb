The letter represents which floor kind it is. Look at the labels above and use the uppercase letter for each. The number identifies each floor of a kind.\nEach transition from one floor to another must be represented by an \"incidence\". Transitions can be separated by whitespace and new lines. A transition is represented by the name of the exiting floor, a hyphen and the name of the entering floor.\nThere are two special floors, \"N\" and \"B\". \"N\" represents the beginning of an Act. There must be a transition from \"N\" to each one of the starting floors that you can choose when you begin an Act. \"B\" represents the Act''s Boss. There must be a transition to \"B\" for each floor that leads to the Act''s Boss.",
